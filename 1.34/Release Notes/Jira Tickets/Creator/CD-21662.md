## Description
In a maintenance template, include a selection allowing the template to be assigned to multiple component groups. The templates should be able to be scheduled like current templates. Reading/Cumulative Reading items can be added to the template, but do not allow selecting a component, instead they will record readings on the exact component that the checklist is being recorded for. Cumulative reading items can propagate to child components as well.
