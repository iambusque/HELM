## Description
We want to perform part search across all of the assets on the division (division equal level or down), the goal is to find other assets holding the specific part in question

Req: PartId, DivisionId?

Res: list of (Asset, PartQuantity) paginated and sorted by qty

And also we want to support minmax, exclude those below minimum

And aggregate both storagelocation and non storage location quantities

â€Œ

GetPartQuantityQuery should be taken out into another service class, and be reused
