## Description
User should be able to use a select all checkbox that would select all the parts on the paginated page.

If the total amount of parts is below 100, we would also display a button on the same row as the asset name, to let the user select every single parts from this asset, this will require making an api request with a bigger page size to get this assets parts below minimum, as the other parts after the first page has not yet been fetched yet due to pagination
