should ShoppingList be Shopping List ?

We noticed another thing, when we set filters and we don't get any results, we are showing the nodata message which could be misleading since the user does not know that filters are currently set specially because the filter is collapsed inside the icon on bottom right. We should probably do something similar to templates where we tell them that 'no result for currently selected filters', currently it seems like there are no items under minimum which could be a little misleading given filters applied are not seen:
